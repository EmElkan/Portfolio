## Automation

Newman is the Postman command-line Collection Runner. It can be easily
integrated with CI and CD pipelines to provide automated API test coverage. Results are available in the
terminal and can be linked to an Azure dashboard or output as a HTML report.

## Dynamic Variables

[Dynamic Variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/variables-list/) allow you to randomly generate values for requests. For example you can generate random names, addresses, images, phone numbers, and ids.

## Pre-request Scripts

[Pre-request scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) can be used to execute JavaScript before a request runs, they can be placed at the collection, folder, or request level. You can carry out pre-processing activities such as setting variable values, parameters, headers, and body data.

## UI Testing

We can leverage Postman's features to test various aspects of a UI, such as asserting that our websites have
the correct security headers or that expected images and text are present.
